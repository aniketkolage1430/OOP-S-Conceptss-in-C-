🌟 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++
🔹 1. Class & Object

📖 Definition: A class is a blueprint, and an object is an instance of that class.

💻 Example: ClassObject.cpp

Name: Aniket, Age: 21


---

🔹 2. Encapsulation

📖 Definition: Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and methods together inside a class. It also helps in data hiding using access specifiers (private, protected, public).

💻 Example: Encapsulation.cpp

Name: Aniket, Age: 21


---

🔹 3. Constructor & Destructor

📖 Definition:

Constructor initializes objects automatically.

Destructor frees resources when objects go out of scope.


💻 Example: ConstructorDestructor.cpp

Constructor called!
Name: Aniket, Age: 21
Destructor called for Aniket

🔹 4. Inheritance

📖 Definition: Inheritance allows one class to reuse features of another.

Types of Inheritance:

1. 🟦 Single Inheritance → One base → one derived


2. 🟪 Multilevel Inheritance → Base → Derived → More Derived


3. 🟨 Multiple Inheritance → Derived from multiple bases


4. 🟩 Hierarchical Inheritance → Many derived from one base


5. 🟥 Hybrid Inheritance → Combination



💻 Examples:

SingleInheritance.cpp

MultilevelInheritance.cpp

MultipleInheritance.cpp

HierarchicalInheritance.cpp

HybridInheritance.cpp


🖥️ Output Example (Multilevel):

Name: Aniket, Roll: 101, Marks: 92.5


---

🔹 5. Polymorphism 🎭

📖 Definition: Polymorphism means many forms – the same function behaves differently in different scenarios.

Types of Polymorphism:

Compile-time

Function Overloading

Operator Overloading


Run-time

Function Overriding (using virtual)



💻 Examples:

Overloading.cpp

OperatorOverloading.cpp

Overriding.cpp


🖥️ Output Example (Overloading):

Name: Aniket
Name: Aniket, Age: 21


---

🔹 6. Abstraction 🎯

📖 Definition: Abstraction hides the implementation and only shows the necessary features.
Achieved using Abstract Classes (Pure Virtual Functions).

💻 Example: Abstraction.cpp

Student Name: Aniket, Age: 21


---

🔹 7. Encapsulation vs Abstraction

📖 Difference:

Encapsulation → Restricting direct access using private members (data hiding).

Abstraction → Hiding implementation details using abstract classes (design hiding).
